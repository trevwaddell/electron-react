# Electron x React Starter

This is starting point for building Electron applications with React and Redux.

The goal of this repo to help engineers get up and running with an electon, react and redux stack.

## Getting Started

After cloning the repo and installing dependencies, running the following script will start the application:

```
$ yarn start
```

_Note_: Initially, this boilerplate was written using Yarn instead of npm, so all of the scripts will ran assuming you also have yarn installed.
